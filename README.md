# Persona 5 Royal Guide


Small wintertime project to build a web guide for optimizing a playthrough of Persona 5 Royal. This guide tells you what options are available each day so that you can plan your perfect playthrough. Personal project to learn handlebars and express for a small web app.

This was hosted on heroku, but that has since shutdown.
